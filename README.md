# Electron Example README
Welcome to my ElectronJS project! I originally created this app as a blank project to help me figure out some things with ElectronJS for work, but I figured this could be useful for people trying to figure it out some best practices or neat tips and tricks. I hope this project proves useful to you!

## Using this Repository
Everything here is meant to be open and available to whoever wants to use it. Much of the code will largely be based off of the [documentation](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest), StackOverflow (or similar sites), or tested AI code from sites like ChatGPT or GitHub Copilot, so it's not exactly any industry secret.

You will also notice a docs folder in the top level of the repository, which is there to give detailed walkthroughs on how to implement certain aspects of ElectronJS. If there is anything unclear in these, or if there are features you want to find out how to implement, send me a message! I would love to improve upon this.

## Project Structure
This project will use [Electron Forge](https://www.electronforge.io) for publishing with GitHub. Releases of the app will be available within GitHub under "Releases" in the project if you want to check them out. There are many other services, like Electron Builder, that are also available, but to keep things simple I will just be using Electron Forge that comes by default.
